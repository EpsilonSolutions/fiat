\section{Introduction}

The client of an Abstract Data Type (ADT) is much like a patron that
commissions a sculpture, relying on the efforts of the ADT implementor
to provide them with a representation and (efficient) set of
operations meeting their specifications. The correctness of the
client hinges on the implementation satisfying the desired
specification. For this reason, there are a multitude of techniques
for verifying that an ADT faithfully implementing a
specification~\cite{foo}. \BD{Why are post-facto verification techniques
  insufficient/unsatisfying?}

This project focuses on an alternative approach: enabling ADT
designers to interactively derive implementations of a specification
which are correct by construction- each derived implementation is
accompanied by an proof that it satisfies its specification.
