\section{Evaluation}

Case studies and evaluation go here.
Potential case studies:
\begin{itemize}
  \item MinPlusMax
  \item Geometric Computing Example-  shows generality
  \item Microbenchmark from Hawkins- perhaps Directed Graph Benchmark
  \item ROSMaster (or an approximation of it)
\end{itemize}
