(* Our bookstore has two relations (tables):
   - The [Books] relation contains the books in the
     inventory, represented as a tuple with
     [Author], [Title], and [ISBN] attributes.
     The [ISBN] attribute is a key for the relation,
     specified by the [where attributes .. depend on ..]
     constraint.
   - The [Orders] relation contains the orders that
     have been placed, represented as a tuple with the
     [ISBN] and [Date] attributes.

   The schema for the entire query structure specifies that
   the [ISBN] attribute of [Orders] is a foreign key into
   [Books], specified by the [attribute .. of .. references ..]
   constraint.
 *)

(* Let's define some synonyms for strings we'll need,
 * to save on type-checking time. *)
Definition sBOOKS := "Books".
Definition sAUTHOR := "Authors".
Definition sTITLE := "Title".
Definition sISBN := "ISBN".
Definition sORDERS := "Orders".
Definition sDATE := "Date".

(* Now here's the actual schema, in the usual sense. *)

Definition BookStoreSchema :=
  Query Structure Schema
    [ relation sBOOKS has
              schema <sAUTHOR :: string,
                      sTITLE :: string,
                      sISBN :: nat>
                      where attributes [sTITLE; sAUTHOR] depend on [sISBN];
      relation sORDERS has
              schema <sISBN :: nat,
                      sDATE :: nat> ]
    enforcing [attribute sISBN for sORDERS references sBOOKS].

(* Aliases for the tuples contained in Books and Orders, respectively. *)
Definition Book := TupleDef BookStoreSchema sBOOKS.
Definition Order := TupleDef BookStoreSchema sORDERS.

(* Our bookstore has two mutators:
   - [PlaceOrder] : Place an order into the 'Orders' table
   - [AddBook] : Add a book to the inventory

   Our bookstore has two observers:
   - [GetTitles] : The titles of books written by a given author
   - [NumOrders] : The number of orders for a given author
 *)

(* So, first let's give the type signatures of the methods. *)
Definition BookStoreSig : ADTSig :=
  ADTsignature {
      Constructor "Init" : unit -> rep,
      Method "PlaceOrder" : rep x Order -> rep x bool,
      Method "DeleteOrder" : rep x nat -> rep x list Order,
      Method "AddBook" : rep x Book -> rep x bool,

      Method "GetTitles" : rep x string -> rep x list string,
      Method "NumOrders" : rep x string -> rep x nat
    }.

(* Now we write what the methods should actually do. *)

Definition BookStoreSpec : ADT BookStoreSig :=

    Def Constructor "Init" (_ : unit) : rep := empty,

    update "PlaceOrder" ( o : Order ) : bool :=
        Insert o into sORDERS,

    update "DeleteOrder" ( oid : nat ) : list Order :=

    update "AddBook" ( b : Book ) : bool :=
        Insert b into sBOOKS ,

     update "DeleteBook" ( id : nat ) : list Book :=

    query "GetTitles" ( author : string ) : list string :=
      For (b in sBOOKS)
      Where (author = b!sAUTHOR)
      Return (b!sTITLE) ,

    query "NumOrders" ( author : string ) : nat :=

                 Where (author = b!sAUTHOR)
