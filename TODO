In General:

* Make a targeted-examples file of examples we want to target with
  this system.

Targeted examples:

* Generalize column constraints to arbitrary propositions, see if we
  can erase them at compile time?

Notes/Ideas:

* Perhaps all queries are secretly either views

For Jason Gross:

* Automate pairing of existing impls to get a particular impl
  (consider using dependent types to force a sorted list of (name,
  spec), so that we have canonicity)

* Use the type inference rule:

  impl(m1)    Mut(m) ⊆ Mut(m1)   Obs(m1) ∩ Obs(m) ≠ ∅  impl(Mut(m) ∪ (Obs(m) - Obs(m1)))
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        impl(m)
