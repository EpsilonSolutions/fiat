In General:

* Make a targeted-examples file of examples we want to target with
  this system.

* Consider having mutators, observers, _and constructors_.

Targeted examples:

* Refinement from "pick arbitrary element of orderless multiset" to
  "pick most recently inserted element of multiset"

* Dijkstra's algorithm (verifying the interesting parts while holding
   the picking method abstract)

* Generalize column constraints to arbitrary propositions, see if we
  can erase them at compile time?

Notes/Ideas:

* Perhaps all queries are secretly either views

For Ben Delaware:

* Automate proof of [refineADT_PreOrder].

* Clean up the caching refinement in ADTRefinement.

* Improve the behavior of [add] to avoid extraneous computation in the
cached version.

* Make a "return the min plus the max" example, which demos refinement
  adding new methods to an ADT

* Look into other examples?

For Jason Gross:

* Add a parametric relation which takes advantage of [bind_bind], so
  we don't need [interleave_autorewrite_refine_monad_with]

* Look into various interesting algorithms, try to find one where
   refinement is useful in constructing implementations
