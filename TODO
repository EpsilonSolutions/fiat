In General:

* Make a targeted-examples file of examples we want to target with
  this system.

Targeted examples:

* Dijkstra's algorithm (verifying the interesting parts while holding
   the picking method abstract)

* Generalize column constraints to arbitrary propositions, see if we
  can erase them at compile time?

Notes/Ideas:

* Perhaps all queries are secretly either views

For Ben Delaware:

* Port the silly "implementation by [Pick]" to new [ADT], from
  ADTImplementation.v

* Define a notion of refinement of methods of an ADT, which allows
  changing the [Model]

* Define a notion of refinement of an entire ADT, using above notion
  of refinement

* Port min/max/sum/prod examples from ADTExamples.v to use [ADT]
  rather than [ADTimpl], refining the computational versions from the
  "implementation by [Pick]"

* Make a "return the min plus the max" example, which demos refinement
  adding new methods to an ADT

* Look into other examples?

For Jason Gross:

* Look into various interesting algorithms, try to find one where
   refinement is useful in constructing implementations
