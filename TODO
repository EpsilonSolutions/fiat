In General:

* Make a targeted-examples file of examples we want to target with
  this system.

Targeted examples:

* Dijkstra's algorithm (verifying the interesting parts while holding
   the picking method abstract)

* Generalize column constraints to arbitrary propositions, see if we
  can erase them at compile time?

Notes/Ideas:

* Perhaps all queries are secretly either views

For Ben Delaware:

*

For Jason Gross:

* Look into various interesting algorithms, try to find one where
   refinement is useful in constructing implementations
