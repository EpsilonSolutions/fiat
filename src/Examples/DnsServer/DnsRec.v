(* recursive server algorithm

MAIN QUESTION: needs to have some way to query the current type of server (the authoritative server)?
can the servers all be stored in some kind of relation?

---

say a question's name n looks like
n4.n3.n2.n1.

recursive server algorithm: 

check cache/relation to see if we know n4.n3.n2.n1. 
  if yes, return it.
  if stored as impossible, return it. 
if not:
   then n3.n2.n1. ... each suffix from most specific to least specific
   start with the first suffix whose IP address s we know. 
   we MUST know the IP address of the root server, at least.

(do >= 1 iterative query:)

ask(s, n):
ask s DNS server for the IP address of the authoritative servers for n (the whole string)
  - if IP address, great, add to cache and return that
  - if referral to server s' authoritative for domain n_i (could be n4, n2, n3, n1), 
    (here the current server will look in relation for the longest prefix and return corresponding nameservers)
    add referral to cache
    recursive call ask(s', n)
  - if s says unknown, add to cache and return failure
(invariant: none of the stuff added to the cache should already be in the cache, guaranteed by the first check)

possible: no end / circular? caching might solve that
- new layer -> refine into this codee

---

does the current server implement referrals?
might need to add a referral response type
(no answer, but contains server names in the authority section and IP addresses of authoritative servers in the additional info section)
seems to exist in packet.v but addns method needs to be revised

the current server will work fine as an authoritative server (it will never do querying, just look in its cache/relation)

see (1) below, is that right? i guess we can do multiple "hops", e.g. we are the com server and we know about scholar.google.com's nameserver and not images.scholar.google.com, so we can skip straight to scholar.google.com
